## 🎯 Why TorchCode?

Top companies (Meta, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, etc.) expect ML engineers to implement core operations **from memory on a whiteboard**. Reading papers isn't enough — you need to write `softmax`, `LayerNorm`, `MultiHeadAttention`, and full Transformer blocks cold.

TorchCode gives you a **structured practice environment** with:

| | Feature | |
|---|---|---|
| 🧩 | **15 curated problems** | The most frequently asked PyTorch interview topics |
| ⚖️ | **Automated judge** | Correctness checks, gradient verification, and timing |
| 🎨 | **Instant feedback** | Colored pass/fail per test case, just like competitive programming |
| 💡 | **Hints when stuck** | Nudges without full spoilers |
| 📖 | **Reference solutions** | Study optimal implementations after your attempt |
| 📊 | **Progress tracking** | What you've solved, best times, and attempt counts |

No cloud. No signup. No GPU needed. Just `make run` — or try it instantly on Hugging Face.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 0 — Try it online (zero install)

**[Launch on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/duoan/TorchCode)** — opens a full JupyterLab environment in your browser. Nothing to install.

### Option 1 — Pull the pre-built image (fastest)

```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 -e PORT=8888 ghcr.io/duoan/torchcode:latest
```

### Option 2 — Build locally

```bash
make run
```

Open **<http://localhost:8888>** — that's it. Works with both Docker and Podman (auto-detected).

## 📋 Problem Set

### 🧱 Fundamentals — "Implement X from scratch"

The bread and butter of ML coding interviews. You'll be asked to write these without `torch.nn`.

| # | Problem | What You'll Implement | Difficulty | Key Concepts |
|:---:|---------|----------------------|:----------:|--------------|
| 1 | ReLU | `relu(x)` | ![Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Easy-4CAF50?style=flat-square) | Activation functions, element-wise ops |
| 2 | Softmax | `my_softmax(x, dim)` | ![Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Easy-4CAF50?style=flat-square) | Numerical stability, exp/log tricks |
| 3 | Linear Layer | `SimpleLinear` (nn.Module) | ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-FF9800?style=flat-square) | `y = xW^T + b`, Kaiming init, `nn.Parameter` |
| 4 | LayerNorm | `my_layer_norm(x, γ, β)` | ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-FF9800?style=flat-square) | Normalization, running stats, affine transform |
| 7 | BatchNorm | `my_batch_norm(x, γ, β)` | ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-FF9800?style=flat-square) | Batch vs layer statistics, train/eval behavior |
| 8 | RMSNorm | `rms_norm(x, weight)` | ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-FF9800?style=flat-square) | LLaMA-style norm, simpler than LayerNorm |

### 🧠 Attention Mechanisms — The heart of modern ML interviews

If you're interviewing for any role touching LLMs or Transformers, expect at least one of these.

| # | Problem | What You'll Implement | Difficulty | Key Concepts |
|:---:|---------|----------------------|:----------:|--------------|
| 5 | Scaled Dot-Product Attention | `scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V)` | ![Hard](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hard-F44336?style=flat-square) | `softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V`, the foundation of everything |
| 6 | Multi-Head Attention | `MultiHeadAttention` (nn.Module) | ![Hard](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hard-F44336?style=flat-square) | Parallel heads, split/concat, projection matrices |

| 12 | Linear Attention | `linear_attention(Q, K, V)` | ![Hard](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hard-F44336?style=flat-square) | Kernel trick, `φ(Q)(φ(K)^TV)`, O(n·d²) |
| 14 | KV Cache Attention | `KVCacheAttention` (nn.Module) | ![Hard](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hard-F44336?style=flat-square) | Incremental decoding, cache K/V, prefill vs decode |

### 🏗️ Full Architecture — Put it all together

| # | Problem | What You'll Implement | Difficulty | Key Concepts |
|:---:|---------|----------------------|:----------:|--------------|
| 13 | GPT-2 Block | `GPT2Block` (nn.Module) | ![Hard](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hard-F44336?style=flat-square) | Pre-norm, causal MHA + MLP (4x, GELU), residual connections |

## ⚙️ How It Works

Each problem has **two** notebooks:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `01_relu.ipynb` | ✏️ Blank template — write your code here |
| `01_relu_solution.ipynb` | 📖 Reference solution — check when stuck |

### Workflow

```text
1. Open a blank notebook           →  Read the problem description
2. Implement your solution         →  Use only basic PyTorch ops
3. Debug freely                    →  print(x.shape), check gradients, etc.
4. Run the judge cell              →  check("relu")
5. See instant colored feedback    →  ✅ pass / ❌ fail per test case
6. Stuck? Get a nudge              →  hint("relu")
7. Review the reference solution   →  01_relu_solution.ipynb
```

### In-Notebook API

```python
from torch_judge import check, hint, status

check("relu")               # Judge your implementation
hint("causal_attention")    # Get a hint without full spoiler
status()                    # Progress dashboard — solved / attempted / todo
```

## 📅 Suggested Study Plan

> **Total: ~6–8 hours spread across 2–3 weeks. Perfect for interview prep on a deadline.**

| Week | Focus | Problems | Time |
|:----:|-------|----------|:----:|
| **1** | 🧱 Foundations | ReLU → Softmax → Linear → LayerNorm → BatchNorm → RMSNorm → SwiGLU MLP | 1–2 hrs |
| **2** | 🧠 Attention Deep Dive | SDPA → MHA → Causal → GQA → Sliding Window → Linear Attn → KV Cache | 3–4 hrs |
| **3** | 🏗️ Integration | GPT-2 Block + speed run (re-implement all, timed) | 1–2 hrs |

Single container. Single port. No database. No frontend framework. No GPU.

## 🛠️ Commands

```bash
make run    # Build & start (http://localhost:8888)
make stop   # Stop the container
make clean  # Stop + remove volumes + reset all progress
```

## 🧩 Adding Your Own Problems

TorchCode uses auto-discovery — just drop a new file in `torch_judge/tasks/`:

```python
TASK = {
    "id": "my_task",
    "title": "My Custom Problem",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "function_name": "my_function",
    "hint": "Think about broadcasting...",
    "tests": [ ... ],
}
```

No registration needed. The judge picks it up automatically.

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Do I need a GPU?</b></summary>
<br>
No. Everything runs on CPU. The problems test correctness and understanding, not throughput.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I keep my solutions between runs?</b></summary>
<br>
Blank templates reset on every <code>make run</code> so you practice from scratch. Save your work under a different filename if you want to keep it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How are solutions graded?</b></summary>
<br>
The judge runs your function against multiple test cases using <code>torch.allclose</code> for numerical correctness, verifies gradients flow properly via autograd, and checks edge cases specific to each operation.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Who is this for?</b></summary>
<br>
Anyone preparing for ML/AI engineering interviews at top tech companies, or anyone who wants to deeply understand how PyTorch operations work under the hood.
